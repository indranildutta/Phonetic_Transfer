# Phonetic transfer
This study examines phonetic transfer between Bengali and English in a group of highly proficient bilingual speakers in India. We measure spectral properties (F1 and F2) of two English vowels to ascertain if L1 influence on L2 increases during mixed-language use, relative to a participant’s unilingual baseline production of L2. Mixed-language data is elicited in two switching paradigms: code-switching and cued picture-naming.

## Bengali and English in India
* Demography
* Sound systems

## What causes transfer and what does it affect?
* Sound categories: changes to representation vs changes during processing
* Source of cross-language interaction: local point of switch vs (global) language co-activation-- Bilingual Language Mode 
    
## Duration of transfer effects
* Long-term vs short-term changes
* Transfer during mixed-language use: localized, reversible

## Asymmetries between languages in extent and direction of transfer
2 potential sources:

1. Language status-- L1 vs L2
2. Difference in sound systems of the languages

* Confounding factors in VOT as site of transfer, need to consider other sound categories
* Need for examining a wider set of languages

## Asymmetries between sounds
2 potential sources:

* position of categories in vowel system
* presence of a competing L1 category

## A note on paradigms: connected speech vs not
 code-switching vs cued picture-naming

## Research questions and hypotheses
* Are L2 vowel categories of proficient bilingual speakers affected by dynamic phonetic transfer during mixed-language production?
* If so-- expect an asymmetry between the vowels in the extent and direction of shift. Expect [ʌ] to be lowered and fronted in the mixed condition. [æ] is expected to
show lowering, but to a lesser extent than [ʌ]
* Is there an observable difference in the extent of transfer between the cued picturenaming and the code-switching paradigms?

# Methodology
- participants
- stimuli
- procedure
- acoustic analysis

# Results

# Discussion and Conclusion

* Mixed language processing temporarily increases cross-language phonetic transfer, causing an L2 vowel to converge towards a related L1 category 
* The extent and direction of shift is mediated by language-specific distribution of sound categories
* In a controlled experimental setup, the postulated discursive factors in a code-switching paradigm does not change the patterns of observed transfer relative to a cued picture-naming paradigm
